# Hi 👋

It’s nice to meet you!

I’m Pratistha Katwal, and I’m from Nepal 🇳🇵. I graduated with a degree in Environmental Science — so yes, I care a lot about the environment and believe in building a greener, safer world. I enjoy working with **data**, whether it’s geospatial data, satellite imagery, or survey responses. I love digging into it to find patterns, trends, and insights that can lead to real solutions to environmental problems.

## 🧩 Projects I’ve Worked On

📍 **Household-Level Flood Risk Assessment @ NAXA Pvt. Ltd.**  
As a Former Research Associate, I contributed to a large-scale flood risk assessment of over **11,000 households** in flood-prone areas of Nepal and Bangladesh.  
I contributed to:
- Analyzing household-level vulnerability and coping capacity  
- Working with flood hazard maps and the **INFORM Risk Model** for risk assessment
- Developing **Household-level disaster risk management plans**  
- Supporting early warning systems through risk monitoring and timely risk communication.

📱 **Structural Damage & Loss Prediction from Flooding App**  
Built a small ML-based prototype that predicts **structural damage and loss** based on the level and duration of flooding.  
Still improving it, but it's a fun mix of household data + machine learning! 👉 [View the App](https://predictinglossanddamage-pratisthakatwal.streamlit.app/)

🛰️ **Satellite & Remote Sensing Projects**  
Explored how NDVI, land surface temperature (LST), and land cover data can be used to study the impact of roadside vegetation in regulating local temperature.
