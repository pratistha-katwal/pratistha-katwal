# Hi 👋

It’s nice to meet you!

I’m Pratistha Katwal from Nepal 🇳🇵. I hold a degree in Environmental Science and have a passion for working with data—whether it’s geospatial datasets, satellite imagery, or survey responses. I’m now combining my love for the environment and data to uncover patterns and insights that drive meaningful, data-informed solutions to today’s environmental challenges.

## 🧩 Projects I’ve Worked On

📍 **Household-Level Flood Risk Assessment @ NAXA Pvt. Ltd.**  
As a Former Research Associate, I contributed to a large-scale flood risk assessment of over **11,000 households** in flood-prone areas of Nepal and Bangladesh.  
I contributed to:
- Analyzing household-level vulnerability and coping capacity  
- Working with flood hazard maps and the **INFORM Risk Model** for risk assessment
- Developing **Household-level disaster risk management plans**  
- Supporting early warning systems through risk monitoring and timely risk communication.

📱 **Structural Damage & Loss Prediction from Flooding App**  
Built a small ML-based prototype that predicts **structural damage and loss** based on the level and duration of flooding.  
Still improving it, but it's a fun mix of household data + machine learning! 👉 [View the App](https://predictinglossanddamage-pratisthakatwal.streamlit.app/)

🛰️ **Satellite & Remote Sensing Projects**  
Explored how NDVI, land surface temperature (LST), and land cover data can be used to study the impact of roadside vegetation in regulating local temperature.
